/**
 * Repair Batch 1.6 — N1, found by the independent review of Batch 1.5.
 *
 * The page's proof of a turn stopped at the turn index: the turn-side binding
 * (the turn's row against its owner run's row) is satisfied by a forged
 * *pair* — both rows moved together — while `verifyRunHistory` refuses the
 * same run on `runs.get`, on the execution window and on the commit
 * confirmation. A page could therefore publish a fragment of a turn whose
 * owner run the host refuses everywhere else. A page now asks for the range
 * under the run read's own authority (`publishableTurnRange`), so it can never
 * be the one reader such a pair still satisfies — while a fragment of a
 * *proven* turn stays exactly as publishable as before.
