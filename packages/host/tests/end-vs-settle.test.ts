/**
 * `turn/end` is not a settled execution.
 *
 * The real Runtime closes its channel right after the turn's last event, so the
 * window between "the turn said it ended" and "the iterator is done" is a couple
 * of microtasks wide and cannot be widened from outside. This file widens it on
 * purpose: the runtime is wrapped — the real one still drives the turn, records
 * the log and reports the outcome — and the wrapper holds the iterator open
 * after its final event. That is the only state in which the host's ownership
 * rule can be observed directly: end observed, nothing settled yet.
 *
 * If the lease were released when `turn/end` arrives, every assertion below
 * would see a free registry and the test would fail.
