/**
 * A cancel whose own announcement cannot be built.
 *
 * The run's `run.updated` is the host's own output; a failure to construct it is
 * a host fault, not a transport problem and not a reason to pretend the
 * cancellation was never announced. The failure is injected exactly where the
 * review put it: in the construction of the cancellation's own event, for the
 * run that is being cancelled. Everything else is real — the real run, the real
 * Core, the real registry and the real protocol encoding.
 *
 * The stream is driven past the point where the host has published the turn's
 * model step, so the only event left to build before the settle is the
 * cancellation's.
