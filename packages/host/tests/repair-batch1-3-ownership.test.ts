/**
 * Repair Batch 1.3 — E2: Run / Turn durable ownership.
 *
 * A run's pointer to its turn and the turn index's own row are two halves of
 * one commit. The regressions here exchange them, move them, and rewrite the
 * accepted input they bind, and check that every public path still refuses the
 * result — while a store written before the binding existed is neither
 * repaired nor guessed at, and its unprovable facts never reach a model.
 *
 * The corruption matrix a reviewer will look for: an exchange (A), a tampered
 * accepted input (B), two claimants (C, covered with the other one-sided
 * cases in the earlier batches), a range that disagrees with the binding (D),
 * a binding in another session (E), the behavior after corruption (F), and
 * the rule that nothing is rewritten to make the damage go away (G).
