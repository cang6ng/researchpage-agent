/**
 * The durable repository: the one place a fact becomes a fact.
 *
 * Everything above this module works with values it can still be wrong about.
 * What crosses this boundary is a transaction: a set of writes that either all
 * happened or none did, checked and committed while no `await` can run, because
 * every call here is synchronous. That is not an accident of the API — it is
 * the property the whole layer rests on. A transaction that could be suspended
 * halfway would be one a model call, a tool or a client could interleave with,
 * and the atomicity the business boundaries promise would be a hope.
 *
 * Three rules shape the implementation.
 *
 * Reads are bounded. A directory page, a run page and a history page each take
 * a bound and return at most that much; there is deliberately no "load
 * everything" call, because a repository that offers one is a repository that
 * will be asked for it, and a long conversation must never be loaded whole just
 * to answer a question about its newest turn.
 *
 * Facts are never rewritten. Sequences are not renumbered, identities are not
 * reused, and a deleted session's id is retired rather than recycled. The one
 * thing this module does to a stored fact is refuse to read it when it is not
 * shaped the way a committed fact must be.
 *
 * Ephemeral is the same code as durable, with the database in memory.
 * `retention` reports which one the caller got, and a durable backend that
 * cannot be opened throws instead of quietly handing back an in-memory one.

 * effective state is a fact about one running instance, and a store that kept
 * it would be claiming an instance's memory on its behalf. A store written
 * before version 3 simply has no configuration, and the first startup after the

   * the only proof that this run's history is its own. The rules are the ones
   * the store's own writes imply: a run that never committed a turn — a host
   * failure, an interrupted run, one still unfinished — carries no range, and a
   * run whose status claims a settled turn, `completed` above all, must carry
   * the range, the turn row and the reason that claim implies. A status that
   * names a committed turn and holds no range is a record disagreeing with
   * itself, and is refused exactly like one pointing at somebody else's turn.
   *
   * Two further facts, because "this turn is mine" is not implied by the turn
   * merely existing:
   *
   * - The turn is this run's own, and the turn's own row says so. Every
   *   terminal commit writes the run's range, its turn and the turn's owner
   *   binding in one transaction, so the two sides are one relation recorded
   *   twice — and the turn's side is the one a swap cannot keep coherent. A
   *   run whose claimed turn is owned by another run, a turn two runs both
   *   claim, and a turn with no owner at all (a store written before the
   *   binding existed) are each a state this store cannot have produced, and
   *   none of them is served from here.
   * - The range holds the canonical facts it claims — the same sequence, turn
   *   closure and tool-pairing rules a history page and an execution window
   *   apply, applied here to the run's own committed range instead of to a cut
   *   out of it — and its first user fact is the input this run accepted,
   *   compared as decoded text, verbatim. That is what makes one authority:
   *   whichever way a client asks about a settled run, the same records are
   *   held to the same rules.
