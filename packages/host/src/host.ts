/**
 * The composition root: one host, owning its storage, its sessions, its runs,
 * its registry and its connections.
 *
 * The host builds everything it needs and hands out nothing. Configuration
 * comes in as trusted defaults and a persisted desired value; a trusted
 * composition turns those into the execution the host will run; the plugins and
 * the grants come in the same way. There is no second entry point that could
 * reach around this one — no pre-built model client, no pre-built context
 * builder — because either would be a way to run something the persisted
 * configuration never approved.
 *
 * Startup is an asynchronous sequence with an owner, not a checklist. Storage
 * is opened and its schema checked first, because nothing may run against a
 * store this build does not understand. Then the desired configuration is read
 * — initialized once from the trusted defaults if the store has never held one
 * — and every value that will become effective is validated *now*, whatever its
 * history: a stored setting is trusted because it passed this check, never
 * because it was once accepted. Only then does the trusted composition build
 * execution, and only after that is the previous instance's unfinished work
 * reconciled. A host that cannot finish the sequence rejects here — it does not
 * come up in a degraded mode, and a durable store that fails never turns into
 * an in-memory one.
 *
 * Shutdown is the same sequence backwards, in the order the resources were
 * taken: stop accepting work, drop the readers, ask the run to stop, wait for
 * everything already accepted to settle, release the plugins, dispose the
 * execution the composition built, and close the store last, after every
 * execution that could still write to it has ended. A startup that fails
 * halfway runs the same tail in the same order, so a composition never outlives
 * the store it was built against.
