/**
 * The trusted composition seam: where settings become execution.
 *
 * Everything a host runs with is decided here and nowhere else. The host reads
 * its *persisted desired* configuration, validates it, and hands the effective
 * values to two things the trusted caller provides: a validator that knows the
 * provider catalogue and endpoint policy, and a factory that turns the values
 * into an executable ModelClient — resolving credentials on the way, which is
 * why a credential never has to exist in this package at all.
 *
 * The seam is deliberately provider-neutral. A `JsonValue` goes in; a Core
 * `ModelClient` comes out; no provider SDK type, catalog, or credential shape
 * appears on either side of it. That is what lets the host stay ignorant of
 * what a "provider" is while still being unable to run on anything the
 * composition did not vouch for.
 *
 * Three rules shape the contract.
 *
 * Validation is the composition's answer, not the caller's guess. The host
 * stores whatever a client asked for and asks `validateModel` at write time and
 * again at startup, because a value that was legal when it was written is not
 * automatically legal when it is read.
 *
 * Composition owns what it took. A `compose` that throws is responsible for
 * whatever it already acquired; a `compose` that returns hands its resources to
 * the host, which disposes them after the plugins have settled and before the
 * store is released.
 *
 * Failures are classified, never quoted. A refusal reason is a fixed, non-secret
 * word from the composition's own vocabulary — the host answers with its own
 * fixed sentence and never puts a reason on the wire.
