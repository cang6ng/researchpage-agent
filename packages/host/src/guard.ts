/**
 * What a managed, durable execution will not accept from a model.
 *
 * The host keeps every settled turn in a store whose records are bounded and
 * whose JSON profile is strict, so there are model outputs that could run but
 * could never be kept: a tool argument carrying `undefined`, a cycle, a `Date`,
 * a value with an accessor, or simply a step whose escaped encoding is larger
 * than one record may hold. Discovering that at commit time is too late by
 * exactly one tool call — the side effect has already happened — so the checks
 * are placed at the one seam that is *before* everything the host does with a
 * step: the model's own stream.
 *
 * Three rules shape the wrapper.
 *
 * One owned step. A tool call is taken over the moment it arrives: its
 * arguments become this host's own isolated JSON snapshot, and that snapshot is
 * what travels on — to the Core's log, to the tool, and to storage. The
 * provider's object is never read again, so a provider that mutates the call it
 * emitted (or a nested object, array or property of it) cannot change what was
 * validated, what ran, or what was recorded. The isolation is a deep copy, not
 * a freeze: freezing the provider's object would still leave the same object in
 * play. Hostile shapes are not executed for inspection either — the JSON guard
 * is descriptor-based, never reads through an accessor and never calls
 * `toJSON`.
 *
 * One validation, on every ending. A step is checked before the Core can act on
 * it — whether the stream says `done` or simply ends, because the Core's
 * contract accepts a natural EOF as a completed step. The check measures the
 * records the step will really become, with the turn's own identity, through
 * the store's own payload builder, against the store's own record bound.
 *
 * One execution input. Nothing here truncates, rewrites, drops a call or
 * weakens an argument. A step that cannot be kept whole, or whose call cannot
 * be owned as JSON, is a step that does not run: it never becomes an assistant
 * record, never declares tool calls, and therefore never reaches the registry.
