 * whether a turn is *complete*, whether it is the turn the host thinks it is, or
 * whether it is structurally something the Core could have written. This is
 * where that is decided, against the evidence the Core actually leaves behind.
 *
 * Identity and position:
 *
 * - every entry in the segment carries the turn id this run bound, and the
 *   segment opens with `turn/start` and closes with the final `turn/end`;
 * - the sequence numbers run unbroken from the published cursor, in order: a
 *   reversed, repeated or skipped position is a log no host can vouch for;
 * - the user input is the text this run accepted, verbatim.
 *
 * Structure:
 *
 * - every tool call an assistant message declared is followed, in order, by its
 *   own `tool/call` and `tool/result`; nothing is dispatched that was not
 *   declared and nothing declared is dropped;
 * - nothing follows the closing `turn/end`.
 *
 * Outcome shape, derived from the Core's own loop rather than from a guess:
 *
 * - `completed` is returned by `runSteps` only immediately after a
 *   `message/assistant` with no tool calls, so a completed turn must end on
 *   exactly that record;
 * - `max_steps` is returned at the top of an iteration, so the turn must carry
 *   at least one assistant record and end on the `tool/result` of the step that
 *   spent the last of the budget;
 * - `cancelled` and `error` are returned before any record of the step that
 *   died — including, at the very start of a turn, before any assistant record
 *   exists — so any prefix that is otherwise consistent is legal for them.
 *
 * Pairing is by occurrence, never by `callId`: the Core allows an empty callId
 * and allows the same one across steps, so a call id is not an identity. The
 * `invocationId` published on each pair is derived from the call event's own
 * log position, which is unique by construction.
 *
 * A segment that fails any of this is not repaired: it throws, and the run ends
 * as a host failure with a blocked session rather than becoming a plausible but
 * wrong history.
