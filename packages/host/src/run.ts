/**
 * Runs: who may start one, what happens while it is alive, and how it ends.
 *
 * Four rules shape everything in this module.
 *
 * Durable before live, always. A run is committed as accepted before it is
 * announced, its start marker is committed before the Runtime is handed
 * anything to execute, and its terminal is committed before any client is told
 * the outcome. Each of those is a single synchronous transaction, so there is
 * no window in which the host has said something it has not recorded.
 *
 * Ownership is taken before a run exists and released only after the Runtime's
 * iterator has settled — not when `turn/end` arrives, not when `abort()` is
 * called. The stream's own completion is the only event that means the Core is
 * done, and everything that must not overlap it waits on exactly that.
 *
 * A window, not a session. Each run loads the bounded suffix of committed turns
 * it needs and releases it when it settles; the rest of the log stays in
 * storage. That is why a long conversation costs the same as a short one to
 * continue, and why nothing here can accidentally read all of history.
 *
 * Publication never gates work. The drain is owned by the host, so a run
 * finishes with no subscriber, no client, and no reading browser, or with a
 * connection that dies mid-flight.
