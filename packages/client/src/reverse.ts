 * METHOD_NOT_FOUND, and answer nothing else.
 *
 * A registration carries a strict params contract of its own: the params arrive
 * as validated JSON, and `accepts` is the only thing standing between them and
 * the handler. An unknown method and a rejected payload are answered
 * differently, because they are different facts.
