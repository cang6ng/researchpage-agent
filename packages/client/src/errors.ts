 * The client's own error vocabulary.

 * wrote; a `connection` error is local transport reality (`CONNECTION_LOST` is
 * never a wire code); a `protocol` error is a peer that broke the frozen
 * contract, which ends the connection; a `client` error is the caller using the
 * client in a way it cannot honour, and nothing was sent.
 *
 * Every message here is written locally. Nothing about the raw frame, the
 * failing internals or a thrown exception travels with an error — only the
 * code, a fixed sentence, and how much the caller may still assume.
