/**
 * The connection: one logical connection to a host, from the connector promise
 * to the last frame it will ever send.
 *
 * Four separations run through this module.
 *
 * The first is epoch versus identity. Every attempt at a connection gets a local
 * `epoch`; every callback — connector completion, frame, close, timer, reverse
 * handler, an `await` continuation — is bound to the attempt that created it,
 * and anything arriving from an older one is inert. `hostInstanceId` is a
 * different fact: it is the host's own identity, learned from `host.describe`,
 * and it distinguishes *which* host this is, never *which* connection.
 *
 * The second is invalidation before publication. A connection that is ending is
 * torn down first — epoch, channel, identity, stream, control ownership,
 * pending — and only then does the client say so. A listener that hears
 * "disconnected" is hearing about a client that can no longer send, reconnect on
 * a stale path, or overwrite a newer attempt. Tearing a connection down runs
 * foreign code — a listener disposer, an abort listener, the transport's own
 * close — and that code may re-enter this client and say something newer; when
 * it has, the transition that was underway publishes nothing, because the newer
 * claim is the state.
 *
 * The third is the frame path versus everything foreign. Frames are routed
 * synchronously: a response settles its pending, an event folds, and the
 * subscription snapshot is installed before the frames behind it are read. A
 * control transaction — `open` above all — takes its ownership synchronously,
 * before it notifies or sends anything, so a reentrant listener starts a *new*
 * transaction instead of joining one that finished.
 *
 * The fourth is the presentation versus the caller. Only a validated open
 * snapshot and validated events move the shared presentation; an operation
 * response resolves its caller and touches nothing else.
