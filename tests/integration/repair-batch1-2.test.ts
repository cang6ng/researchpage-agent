/**
 * Repair Batch 1.2, R02 at the Client boundary: when a terminal commit cannot
 * be judged, the presentation a connected client holds stops being claimed as
 * current — immediately, and without a fabricated terminal.
 *
 * The host's own reconciliation is covered by the host tests; what is checked
 * here is what a *reader* is shown. A host that cannot confirm what storage
 * holds must not keep streaming a live presentation as if it could, and it must
 * not invent an outcome to replace the one it cannot prove. The one signal the
 * contract has for that is the connection itself ending: the client keeps the
 * presentation it had, marked stale, drops the drafts it was watching, and every
 * new execution is refused with STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE until a restart reconciles
 * the durable facts.
