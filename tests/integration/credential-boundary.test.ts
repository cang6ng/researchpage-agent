/**
 * M3 — the credential boundary, with a sentinel.
 *
 * A credential is generated at runtime, injected as the trusted composition's
 * own value, and then looked for everywhere the host can produce output: the
 * database (bytes and rows), every snapshot and summary, every frame on the
 * wire, the client's replica, the run's terminal, the startup failures and the
 * captured console. It is found in exactly one place — the authorization header
 * of the request the provider really received — and nowhere else.
 *
 * The socket is stubbed, the serializer is real, and the sentinel is never
 * written into the source: it exists only as a string this test made up.
