/**
 * Acceptance J at the Host → Client boundary: what happens to a tool input the
 * durable JSON profile cannot carry.
 *
 * v2 answers this before anything depends on it. Every case here is a value
 * JSON cannot carry: `undefined`, a bigint, a non-finite number, a function, a
 * sparse array, a `Date`, a `Map`, a class instance, a cycle, and an object with
 * its own `toJSON`. For each of them the managed execution refuses the model
 * step it arrived in — before the tool is dispatched, before an assistant record
 * is written, before any canonical tool call exists — so the tool count is zero
 * and nothing is fabricated to stand in for the call. A refused step is also
 * not *read*: the guard never invokes an accessor or a `toJSON` to decide.
 *
 * The JSON-safe case is the other half: the projection is a complete deep
 * snapshot, later edits to the original do not reach through it, and the tool
 * still receives the object the model produced.
