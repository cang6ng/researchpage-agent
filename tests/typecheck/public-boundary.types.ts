/**
 * The package boundary, from a consumer's point of view.
 *
 * The reverse seam is deliberately internal: a host or client is composed with
 * `createHost` / `createClient`, and the test-only profiles are not something a
 * consumer can reach. This checks that claim the way a consumer would experience
 * it — by package name — rather than by reading the manifest.
 *
 * It is a module, not a test: vitest does not collect it, and the typecheck does,
 * which is exactly the pair of gates the boundary needs.
