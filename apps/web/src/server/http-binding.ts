/**
 * The web server binding: a `node:http` endpoint that carries protocol frames
 * between a host and a browser-shaped client.
 *
 * Shape of one logical connection:
 *
 *   POST /connections            → { connectionId, token }   (short-lived, in memory)
 *   GET  /connections/:id/events → the downstream stream: `text/event-stream`
 *   POST /connections/:id/frames → one frame per request, answered 204
 *
 * Three rules keep it honest. A 204 means the carrier has the frame, never that
 * the host did anything with it. The upstream never waits for the host: it
 * enqueues and answers, so a request that is itself waiting for a reverse answer
 * cannot deadlock behind its own reply. And a frame that cannot be carried —
 * too large, a full queue, a stalled reader — ends the connection instead of
 * being dropped quietly, because the sequence numbers upstream depend on
 * delivery being all-or-nothing.
 *
 * The binding knows nothing about sessions, runs, plugins or agents: it sees
 * strings, connections and bounded queues.
